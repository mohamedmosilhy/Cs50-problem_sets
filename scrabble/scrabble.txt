get the two words from the user
call the function compute_score
change the two words to the lower case
FOR (int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++)
    IF (word1[i] <= 'z' and word1[i] >= 'a' ) THEN
        location = word1[i] - 96
        sum = sum + points[location]
return sum
IF (sum1>sum2) THEN
PRINT Player 1 wins!
ELSE IF sum1=sum2
PRINT Tie!
ELSE
PRINT Player 2 wins!
