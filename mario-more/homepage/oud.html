        <h1>The Oud Instrument </h1>
        <p>
            In the Arab origin, Oud is considered to be “the king of instruments”. It is assumed that the name al-oud is derived from the Arabic<br>
            for “the wood” and came to Europe through North Africa. There will be nothing wrong to say that in Arab, the oud is considered to be<br>
            the oldest musical instruments. In fact, it is the most central instrument in the Middle Eastern music tradition. Some others believe<br>
            that it is the ancestor of the Pharaohnic Egyptian Nefer, whereas, some others say that this instrument is the forebear of the ancient<br>
            Persian barbat. Beside this, oud is also known as the ancestor of the European lute.<br>
