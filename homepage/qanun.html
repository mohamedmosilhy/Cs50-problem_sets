        <h1>The Qanun Instrument </h1>
        <p>
            The Qanun is a descendent of the old Egyptian harp. It has played an integral part in Arabic music since the 10th century. The word<br>
            qanun means "law" in Arabic, and the word exists in English in the form of "canon". This name was probably given to the qanun because<br>
            it's the instrument that lays down the law of pitch for other instruments and singers.<br>
            <br><br>
            The body of the qanun consists of a trapezoid-shaped flat wooden board over which 81 strings are stretched in groups of three, with 24<br>
            treble strings consisting of three strings to each note. The instrument is placed flat on the knees of the musician or on a small<br>
            table. Qanun strings are plucked with two plectra, one plectrum attached to the forefinger of each hand. A long bridge on the<br>
            right-hand side of the instrument rests on goat (or fish) skin covered windows that carry the resonance to the box. On the left hand<br>
            side, each course of strings passes over a series of small brass levers that are used to make microtonal changes in pitch.<br>
            <br><br>
            Since the qanun only includes 8 notes per octave, the player initially sets the levers to create the scale of the starting maqam.<br>
            When the player needs to modulate to another maqam, they need to switch some levers back and forth with the left hand while playing<br>
            with the right hand. Quick modulation can also be achieved by using the fingernail of the left thumb to temporarily raise the tuning<br>
            of some strings.<br>
