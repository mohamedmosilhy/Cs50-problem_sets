        <h1>The kamanja Instrument </h1>
        <p>
            The violin (called kamanja or kaman in Arabic) was incorporated into the Arabic ensemble toward the end of the 19th century<br>
            and replaced indigenous varieties of fiddles like the kamanja, rababa, and jowza. While the argument can be made that the<br>
            violin is the most obvious example of an Arabized instrument, it has long been naturalized, and has acquired its own tuning,<br>
            playing technique and ornamentation style. The Arabic violin's sound is as esential to Arabic music as that of the oud and<br>
            the qanun.<br>
