        <h1>The Nay Instrument </h1>
        <p>
            The Nay (Farsi for "reed") is an open-ended, obliquely end blown flute made of cane. They nay was known in the Near East since antiquity.<br>
            It is nine-jointed, and usually has 6 holes in the front for the fingers to play and 1 hole underneath for the thumb. It is played with<br>
            the pads of the fingers. Nays come in different lengths, each one being tuned to a specific pitch and named after the note produced<br>
            with the 1st fingerhole open (D4 for the most commonly used nay; Lowest note: C4).<br>
            <br><br>
            Although very simple, the nay is one of the most difficult Arabic instruments to play. A fine player can produce a large variety of liquid<br>
            sounds and ornaments; it is an extremely soulful instrument. Its poetical timbre makes it especially suitable for melancholy effects<br>
            expressing both joy and yearning. It is the only wind instrument used in Arab art music, widely appreciated for its warm, breathy sound<br>
            and its subtle tonal and dynamic inflections.<br>
